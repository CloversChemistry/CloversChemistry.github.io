## Website Goal
The goal of this website is to create an interactive and visual way to view parts of my academic and professional career.  This highlights projects and skills I learned during my journey that may otherwise have been left in the past. This website is a living document that will be forever growing, just like me.

Click through the links provided at the top of the page to explore my graduate research, teaching experience, and some graduate and undergraduate projects.

My resume and CV can be found at the bottom of this page.
