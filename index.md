## About me
insert about me here

## Website Goal
The goal of this website is to create an interactive and visual way to view some parts of my academic and professional career.
Other points: showcase past projects, put all my info into one organized place, more than what a resume or cv can show. Also a good introduction to gituhub, html, and markdown programming.
