## Website Goal
The goal of this website is to create an interactive and visual way to view parts of my academic and professional career. It highlights projects and skills I learned during my academic journey that may otherwise be left in the past including things from course projects, internships, and previous jobs. This website is a living document that will be forever growing, just like me. <br>
Click through the links provided at the top of the page to explore my graduate research as well as some graduate and undergraduate projects. My resume and CV can be found at the bottom of this page. 

## About me
My name is Jacob Sindorf, a current PhD student in Systems Engineering at Arizona State University. A true Arizona native, I have lived my entire life in the Grand Canyon state, from my first steps until my dissertation (and perhaps beyond). Staying active through sports in high school kept me busy, but I always had a strong background in academia through AP courses and the guidance of many amazing teachers along the way. <br>
After high school I found myself yearning to move as far away from home as possible. Ambitious and determined, I landed a daunting 150 miles away, in Tucson Arizona. The sunny skies and dusty roads of Tucson presented a major fork in my career, engineering or medical school. Confident, I already knew my decision and went straight down the middle of both of them with biomedical engineering. Four years pass, and the opportunity to further my education finally gave me a way to move even farther from home. This time a full 50 miles to be exact. <br>
The final semester at UofA was cut short due to COVID, and my first year at ASU was almost entirely through a computer screen. Adversity, however, always provides a way to grow. I took the time to focus on becoming an independent scholar, an individual whose skill set makes them an irreplaceable member of any team. After a year hunched in front of a computer screen, I now walk the home stretch of my PhD with a Masterâ€™s degree in hand. With 2 out of 3 degrees completed and 0 out of 3 graduation ceremonies, I have to make the most out of my final chance to dawn the cap and gown. <br> <br>
