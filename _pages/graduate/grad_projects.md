    #title: "Embedded Deep Learning Heart Rate Estimation Device"
    excerpt: 'This project showcases an embedded heart rate (HR) estimation device. Using machine learning and TensorFlow lite, a trained algorithm can be deployed to an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to make heart rate predictions in real time based on a wearable photoplethysmogram (PPG) and tri axial accelerometer. <br><br>

    #title: "Anatomy Inspired Animatronic Head"
    excerpt: 'Deriving from anatomical inspiration, this project creates a fully controllable animatronic head through an ESP32, stepper motors, and a Bluetooth connected PS3 controller. This project allows for individual control of both eyes, each end of the lips, and the neck in 3 dimensions. Through kinematic calculations, the PS3 controller can be mapped to control the neck through real time rotations of the controller. <br><br>

    #title: "egr608 title"
    excerpt: 'Data-Driven techniques have become a staple part of research including dynamic discovery. This utilizes datasets, such as time series data, to create mathematical descriptions of the underlying dynamics. Here this project starts the foundation by applying these techniques to a photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal. Specifically, the techniques of time linear system identification and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY). <br><br>

    #title: "EEE598 RL title"
    excerpt: 'Reinforcement Learning (RL) reduces the mathematical complexity of robotic tasks such as reaching by rewarding or penalizing a system through a series of training tasks. This project improves the reproducibility of a RL project revolving around real reaching tasks with a UR5 arm. Overall, two methods of RL were applied to the UR5, being trust region policy optimization (TRPO) and proximal policy optimization (PPO). These then trained in real time on the UR5 hardware, successfully training the UR5 arm to reach specific points in a 2D space optimally. <br><br>

    #title: "EEE598 LB title"
    excerpt: 'This work proposes a potential way to apply filters to reduce the motion artifacts of a photoplethysmogram (PPG) while also creating some sensor system energy savings. Through a Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework and a Point Based Value Iteration (PBVI) algorithm, optimal actions can be selected to either observe accelerometer data for activity recognition, or choose to apply a noise reducing filter. This project is a theoretical approach and verifies that through the described methods, it would be possible to achieve energy savings and signal noise reduction while maintaining a high state prediction accuracy. <br>

    #title: "EGR557 title"
    excerpt: 'Foldable robotics are both inexpensive and capable of rapid prototyping, allowing for quick verification and testing. Here the problem of how to create unique motion through minimal actuators was explored, and a final single actuated paper leg robot was created. The paper leg was tested at different stiffness values to find the optimal leg for distance travel in a set period of time. Extensive python kinematic and dynamic simulation was used to verify the system, and a final GitHub pages website was made to document the entire process. <br><br>

    #title: "MAE598 title"
    excerpt: 'This project takes inspiration from the muscleâ€™s anatomy in the design and testing of a soft passive ankle orthotic. A low-cost pneumatic actuator worn from the foot to the knee intends to provide dorsi and plantarflexion assistance. Through an air reservoir under the ball of the foot, the system can be passively actuated when stepped on to fill the actuator with air, extending it. Overall, the system was able to provide dorsiflexion assistance and a slight reduction in muscle effort. Verification of the system was done through filtered EMG and goniometer data, as well as force plate response to heel strikes.<br><br>
