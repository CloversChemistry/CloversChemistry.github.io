## About
Foldable robotics are both inexpensive and capable of rapid prototyping, allowing for quick verification and testing. Here the problem of how to create unique motion through minimal actuators was explored, and a final single actuated paper leg robot was created. The paper leg was tested at different stiffness values to find the optimal leg for distance travel in a set period of time. Extensive python kinematic and dynamic simulation was used to verify the system, and a final GitHub pages website was made to document the entire process.

## Description

Similar to this GitHub created site, the main way to document this project and all of its subsequent steps are contained to this GitHub [Project Website](https://l-terrestris.github.io/). Clicking the link will bring you to the course projects website where all the assignments and videos can be found. <br>
The project involved heavy kinematic and dynamic simulation in Python. This tested how a sarrus linkage would move, and eventually how the paper leg would move. Halfway through the semester a drastic project change was done switching from a multi-sarrus linkage robot to a leg robot to better fit the scope of the class. The initial project begun around the general topic of Navigating Tight Spaces with Foldable Robotics. This was narrowed down to answer the question: “How can foldable techniques translate a small number of actuators into unique locomotion?” <br>
The final presentation, presentation 3, [found here](https://l-terrestris.github.io/Presentations/Presentation_3), briefly summarizes the entire project. Overall, an optimal paper leg stiffness was found, with similar results to the simulations, to achieve the maximum distance traveled.
