    #title: "Anatomy Inspired Animatronic Head"
    excerpt: 'Deriving from anatomical inspiration, this project creates a fully controllable animatronic head through an ESP32, stepper motors, and a Bluetooth connected PS3 controller. This project allows for individual control of both eyes, each end of the lips, and the neck in 3 dimensions. Through kinematic calculations, the PS3 controller can be mapped to control the neck through real time rotations of the controller. <br><br>

    excerpt: 'Data-Driven techniques have become a staple part of research including dynamic discovery. This utilizes datasets, such as time series data, to create mathematical descriptions of the underlying dynamics. This project starts the foundation by applying these techniques to a photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal, specifically, the techniques of time linear system identification and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY). <br><br>
