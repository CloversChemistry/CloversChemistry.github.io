## Research Interests
My current research interests revolve around wearable devices and robotics. Specifically, the use and dynamics behind the photoplethysmography (PPG). PPG is a simple optical sensor that measures changes in blood volume levels commonly used to interpret heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. Throughout my degree I have focused on using embedded machine learning, dynamical discovery, and more to develop improved heart rate detection systems while also better understanding the bio-signal. <br> 

Three projects serve as the basis for my current research. <br><br> 
- The first is a continuation of a graduate project on [Embedded Heart Rate Estimation](/bmi598_page/). Some major changes have been made to the project including the use of Edge Impulse and the addition of initial subject testing. This project focuses on Python, Arduino, Machine Learning, and wearable devices. 
- The second is a continuation of a graduate project on [Data Driven Dynamic Discovery of the PPGPermalink](/egr608_page/). More work has been done exploring other nonlinear systems and fine tuning the SINDy algorithm. 
- Laslty, is the project [PBVI for Motion Artifact and Sensor System Energy Savings](/eee598lb_page/). future work will look applying a real sensor system to use as the basis for energy costs and optimal sensor choice.
