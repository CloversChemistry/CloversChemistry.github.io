## Research Interests
My current research interests revolve around wearable devices and robotics. Specifically, the use and dynamics behind the photoplethysmography (PPG). PPG is a simple optical sensor that measures changes in blood volume levels commonly used to interpret heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. Throughout my degree I have focused on using embedded machine learning, dynamical discovery, and more to develop improved heart rate detection systems while also better understanding the bio-signal.
