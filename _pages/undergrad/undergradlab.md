## About
Running statistics on brain regions allows us to see significant differences between subject groups. This project used brain scans from male and female subjects, some healthy, and some with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Through FreeSurfer, the brain regions of each scanned brain can be collected and split up by volume, thickness, and area. With that information, statistical differences in the healthy and MCI group can be explored. All data were organized in Excel and all statistics were done through JMP (t-tests). This work was in contribution to a paper written by Dr. Carissa Grijalva in which I am listed as a contributor. The published paper can be found [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33783915/).

## Description
My specific contribution to this project was the organization of the FreeSurfer data. Once organized in excel, it was possible to run the data through JMP and find significant differences between groups. This was done by comparing the P value output from JMP. The regions with significant differences in volume, thickness, or area, determine either an increase or decrease which may be an indication of MCI. The published results show the regions of importance and describes the project in depth. This project was led by now Dr. Carissa Grijalva in collaboration with Dr. Nima Toosizadeh, and Dr. Kaveh Laksari.
