    #title: "undergrad lab"
    excerpt: 'Running statistics on brain regions allows us to see significant differences between subject groups. This project used brain scans from male and female subjects, some healthy, and some with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Through FreeSurfer, the brain regions of each scanned brain can be collected and split up by volume, thickness, and area. With that information, statistical differences in the healthy and MCI group can be explored. All data were organized in Excel and all statistics were done through JMP (t-tests). This work was in contribution to a paper written by Dr. Carissa Grijalva in which I am listed as a contributor. The published paper can be found [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33783915/).<br><br>

    excerpt: 'The BIO5 Ambassadors is a yearlong internship that allows interns to earn class credit. In the program students learn about collaboration between business and science, attend weekly professional development workshops, and work with a BIO5 staff mentor on a personalized project. The summer of 2019 I was able to organize and revamp this internship program for the 2019-2020 school year. I interviewed and hired an intern, as well as organized and set up intern activities such as weekly professional development workshops.<br><br>

    #title: "senior design"
    excerpt: 'UofA senior design was a cross-disciplinary yearlong engineering project that put us into teams of five to solve a problem issued by a sponsor. Through Roche Tissue Diagnostics, my team worked to design an automatic pick and place device, intended to be used on the factory floor. This would pick up small, quarter sized tracking buttons, and place them onto a roll of tape for easy distribution. As team lead, I handled and organized all team activities as well as all communication with the sponsor. On top of that, I also created all the Solidworks designs and parts that were delivered to the sponsor and drafted all written documents and presentations. Overall I took on the roles of team lead, project manager and head CAD designer and we were able to deliver the plans to create a pick and place device (full deployment of the device was cut short due to COVID). <br><br>

    #title: "SURE program"
    excerpt: 'Laser patterning cells allows for a high spatial and temporal resolution. With the practice of laser guidance, cells (e.g., epithelial) can be patterned accurately to observe their behavior under a defined microenvironment. Eventually, laser patterned cells can be added to 3D bio-printed materials. In order to achieve this, a micron accurate stage that moves in XYZ directions, changes speeds, and stores and returns to specific 3D spatial positions is needed. This research is concentrated on development and design of the Joystick controlled stage. <br><br>

Through a Raspberry Pi, Python, Solidworks, a laser cutter, and a 3D printer, a final skittle sorting device was created. The final device was able to sort skittles with over 90% accuracy and performed at relatively fast speeds. <br><br>
